# Power BI Superstore Sales & Forecast Dashboard
This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI project focused on analyzing sales performance and forecasting future trends for a superstore. The dashboard is built to provide actionable insights for        stakeholders, allowing them to understand historical performance and anticipate future sales.
# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create an all-in-one analytical tool for the superstore's management team. It answers key business questions such as:

 1. What are our top-line metrics for profit, sales, and quantity?
 2. Which regions and states are driving the most sales and profit?
 3. What are the most popular product categories and shipping methods?
 4. What are the sales and profit trends over time (Year-over-Year)? 
 5. What is our 15-day sales forecast, and how does it vary by state?

The report is divided into two main pages: a Main Sales Dashboard for a high-level overview and a Sales Forecast Dashboard for predictive analytics.
